It’s almost like a reverse mermaid with the top being dolphin and the bottom being man. At 23 years of age, the Dolphin-Man works as one of the ambassadors between the United Nations and the underwater city of Atlantis. Quite the prestigious position for someone so young, but supposedly he is much older when counting in dolphin years. The Dolphin-Man’s true name is a well kept mystery. People have tried to find out his supposed real name by asking the Dolphin-Man’s father who is currently the head cetologists at the land branch of the Atlantian Institute of Marine Biology. He has always declined to answer, and isn’t very welcoming towards the media ever since the whole Dolphingate scandal a few decades ago while he was working as janitor at his hometown’s local aquarium. Asking the Dolphin-Man’s mother has also yielded no information since she is a dolphin, and she only speaks Dolphinese. It’s hypothesized the Dolphin-Man’s name may actually be in Dolphinese, and thus can’t be properly pronounced by humans, or maybe it really is just “Dolphin-Man”. What does any of this have to do with Minecraft? Not really anything at all, but it’s still interesting.</p></div><br><br><div class="image-container"><img class="image-in-container" style="width:69%;" src="assets/Images/Dolphin-Man in Atlantis.jpg" alt="(Image alt text)"><p class="image-label-text">Photo of the Dolphin-Man in Atlantis</p></div><br><br><br><div class="text-box"><p class="section-title-text">The Dolphin-Man's Minecraft Server</p><p>In his free time the Dolphin-Man enjoys playing Minecraft, especially with lots of mods. The Dolphin-Man’s love of Minecraft is no secret, and it has been speculated it’s one of the main reasons Mojang (the company which created Minecraft) decided to add dolphins into the game. The Dolphin-Man has decided to open up his previously private modded Minecraft server to the public. Yes, that’s right, you can join and maybe even have an encounter with the Dolphin-Man himself! The server has quite the mod-list and is widely considered to be the greatest modded Minecraft server to ever exist according to an elite team of History Channel historians.</p><br><br></div></div></div></div><div class="menu-bar-container-div"><div class="menu-bar"><a href="Dolphin-Man home page.html"><div id="logo"></div></a><a href="information.html"><button class="menu-bar-button"><p>Information</p></button></a><a href="server news.html"><button class="menu-bar-button"><p>Server News</p></button></a><a href="gallery.html"><button class="menu-bar-button"><p>Gallery</p></button></a><a href="downloads and installation.html"><button class="menu-bar-button"><p>Downloads</p></button></a></div></div></div><!-- JavaScript file link (For the IP address display functionality) --><script type="text/javascript" src="JavaScript/IP_display_script.js"></script></body><!-- Write some comments here! :) --></html>
