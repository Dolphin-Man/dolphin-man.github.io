If you only plan to only ever play from one computer and from one modded Minecraft installation, then feel free to skip this section. Please read this if you are having trouble joining the server and are getting a "Wrong Password" message.</p><p>For security reasons the Dolphin-Man Modded Minecraft Server uses a plugin named "Simple Login". This plugin will prompt the user to input a password (or generate a password randomly) on first launch with the plugin installed. This password is stored in plain text in the user's modded Minecraft installation directory as ".sl_password". Once the password is set at the start, the user will never have to type in any passwords again. An obfuscated hashed version of this password is sent to and saved on the server for indentity verification when first joining (don't worry, the actual password is never sent, only the hashed version). If the password hash value does not match the hash value saved by the server, the request to join the server will be denied. This can cause a problem when trying to join the server from different Minecraft installations such as on a different computer. Unless the exact same password is set on all installations, there will be issues joining.</p><p>To make sure there are no issues joining the server on all modded Minecraft installations, make sure the same password is set for all of them. This can be done by simply entering the same password the first launch of each installation. This can also be done by making sure the ".sl_password" files in all modded Minecraft installations match the original. (Just copy the ".sl_password" file from the original installation directory, and use it to replace the file by the same name in the other modded Minecraft installation directories.)</p><p>TL;DR - (Too Lazy ; Didn't Read):<br>Make sure the ".sl_password" file is the same and contains the correct login password in all modded Minecraft installations you want to join the server with.</p><br><br><hr></div><br><br></div></div></div><div class="menu-bar-container-div"><div class="menu-bar"><a href="Dolphin-Man home page.html"><div id="logo"></div></a><a href="information.html"><button class="menu-bar-button"><p>Information</p></button></a><a href="server news.html"><button class="menu-bar-button"><p>Server News</p></button></a><a href="gallery.html"><button class="menu-bar-button"><p>Gallery</p></button></a><a href="downloads and installation.html"><button class="menu-bar-button"><p>Downloads</p></button></a></div></div></div></body></html>
